# bank_loan_prediction_classifier : I found this project in Kaggle and recreated it to learn various ensemble models and classification metrics.

- Challenges faced :
  
  • Presence of junk characters, nulls etc and outliers which needed feature engineering and outlier treatment. 

  • Encoding of categorical columns.

- Tools / techniques used :
  
  • Google colab along with pandas, numpy, Sci Kit learn, visualization libraries etc. 

  • Techniques include preprocessing, feature transformation, outlier detection and treatment, study of visualization graphs, model evaluations and hyper parameter 
  tuning. 
  
  • Model selection based on confusion matrix scores and test accuracy scores. 

- Model Selection :
  
  • Several models were compared on the basis of accuracy scores (e.g. Logistic Regression, XGBoost, Decision Tree, Random Forest) 

  • Best numbers were returned by the Logistic Regression. 

- Project outcome :
  
  • Predict the eligibility of bank loan on the basis of applicants' age, income, background, collateral and credit history.
